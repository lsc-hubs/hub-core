# LSC-Hub Core template

LSC hub template is a template for a national hub in Africa around Land Soil Crop Data. The hubs are being prepared as part of the [Land, Soil and Crop Information Services to support Climate-Smart Agriculture](https://lsc-hubs.org) project.
This four-year project (2021-2024) is jointly funded by the European Union's [Development Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture](https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/programming/programmes/desira-development-smart-innovation-through-research-agriculture_en)
(DeSIRA) program, The [Netherlands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-foreign-affairs) and [ISRIC - World Soil Information](https://isric.org).

## CMS

This repository contains the content which builds the website of the hub, the content uses [quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a tool to render markdown as html. When pushing markdown-changes to this repository, Github Actions triggers a rebuild of the website in gh-pages branch. 

## National-level data hub

In Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda, land, soil and crop data from many sources are being consolidated into data portals, or hubs, where these data can be stored, processed and visualized. 
This repository offers a participatory environment to share ideas, software components, deployment scripts and training material to build up the hub iteratively.
