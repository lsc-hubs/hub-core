MapServer is a platform for publishing spatial data to the web. Originally developed in the mid-1990â€™s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an MIT-style license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X). MapServer is not a full-featured GIS system, nor does it aspire to be.

## Mapserver in LSC hubs

Mapserver is used to create map services on data which is stored on the LSC hub. This makes the data better available, for example within TerriaJS.
