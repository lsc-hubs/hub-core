The LSC hub has been build using a number of effective off-the-shelf components:

- [Quarto](./quarto.md) for content management (webpages and documentation)
- [pycsw catalogue](./pycsw.md) to enable searches for data and documents
- [mapserver](./mapserver.md) to provide data access to spatial datasets
- [terriajs](./terria.md) provides a viewer for spatial data files and services

Examples of deployment in Kubernetes as well as Docker are available.
