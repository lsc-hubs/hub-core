Findable - Accessible - Interoperable - Reusable

# Findable

- The first step in (re)using data is to find them. 
- Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. 
- Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.
- Persistent identification

## Persistent identification

Persistent identification, for continued findability

- Consider that a proper id can outlive a project (or organisation)
- Choice of domain and path (owned, authoritative, neutral, prevent names)
- Set up an identification proxy (doi.org/w3id.org)

## Metadata

- Metadata describes title, abstract, author of a resource
- Facilitate findability and understand if a resource is relevant
- Can organize resources in groups by tagging

## Standards for metadata exchange

- Facilitate the exchange of resources between communities
- Protocols to exchange metadata:

| Community | Standard | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open data/Sematic web | DCAT | SPARQL |
| Science | Datacite | OAI-PMH | 
| Geospatial | iso19115 | CSW |
| Earth observation | STAC | STAC |
| Search engines | Schema.org | json-ld/microdata |
| Ecology | EML | |

## Catalogue

- Records are brought into a catalogue, where they can be searched and assessed
- Catalogues can exchange records to increase discoverability
- Catalogues can cross borders between communities by transforming metadata to relevant community standards and protocols

## Search engines

- Search engines crawl the content of catalogues 
- If a catalogue supports schema.org annotations, the content can also be extracted in a structured way
- Example



# Accessibility

- (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
- Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## Persistence

- Move the resource to a shared environment (backup)
- Consider a URL strategy
- Use a facade identifier (DOI) 

## Data lifecycle

- Consider upfront when to remove a resource (10 yrs?)
- What happens to the URI of a resource which is archived?
- Metadata should stay available, even if the data are no longer

## Repository software

- Webdav (or webserver software)
- Zenodo, Dataverse
- Document Management Systems (DMS)
- Cloud storage (google drive, dropbox, Amazon, Sharepoint)

## testing tools

- Automated link checking
- Usage logs filter on status 404 & referer
- Google Search Console notifies broken links 


# Interoperable


- (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data



## Universal formats

Facilitates accessing a resource with commonly available tooling, or be refactored if a software is abandoned

- Proprietary vs Open (eg. ecw vs tiff)
- De facto vs Formalised (eg. YAML vs XML)
- Binary vs text based (eg. shapefile vs GeoJSON)
- Cloud optimised vs Cloud native vs traditional (eg. COG vs GeoZarr vs GeoTiff)
- Embedded metadata

## Adopt common vocabularies

Adopting a standardised model enables aggregation of data.

- Relational models
- UML/GML models
- Semantic web ontologies

## Relevant vocabularies

- ISO28258 / INSPIRE / GLOSIS Web Ontology
- Agrovoc
- WRB / FAO Soil Classification Guidelines



# Reusable

- (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

- (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

- (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

- (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
