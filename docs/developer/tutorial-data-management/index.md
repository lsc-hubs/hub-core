This tutorial presents a workshop on effective (spatial) data maintenance. The tutorial is under active development, we welcome you to leave [your feedback](https://github.com/lsc-hubs/hub-core).

The first section introduces the [FAIR data principles](./0-fair-data.md), focusing on the soil domain, which form a basis of the data management approach suggested in the next sections.

On the tutorial some tools are introduced, which are selected considering:

- Open source license
- Vivid community (persistence) 
- Support of standards (prevent [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in))

Incidentally alternative options are indicated, because other tools may fit better with existing practices in your organisation.

Git has a central role in the training, it is for example suggested to facilitate software development and deployment, content co-creation and management as well as community feedback.

You can also access the [slides](./slides/) of the workshop.

We hope you enjoy the materials, 

Tha√Øsa, Paul, Giulio and Luis.
