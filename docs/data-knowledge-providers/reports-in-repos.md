The deposition of reports, policy briefs and educational materials in persistent knowledge repositories is not merely a matter of good practice but a fundamental requirement for a robust, transparent, and efficient modern Land Soil Crop ecosystem. The FAIR Principles provide a powerful, internationally recognized framework for justifying this mandate. By ensuring that reports are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, PKRs safeguard our collective intellectual output, accelerate the pace of discovery by preventing redundant work, and uphold the core scientific values of verification and cumulative knowledge building. Funding agencies, institutions, and researchers themselves should therefore treat the deposition of all significant research outputs into certified repositories as a non-negotiable final step in the research lifecycle.

There are various reasons why relevant reports are incidentally not deposited in a library. It is relevant to identify
and prevent these reasons, so all relevant information is carefully archived.

- The researcher or funder may require non-disclosure or an embargo period. Consider that most repositories offer functionality for selective disclosure or embargoed access.
- In some cases researchers accidently select non persistent media to disclose an asset. Capacity building or proper guidance may prevent the situation.

An aspect incidentally overlooked is that besides publishing in a persistent repository, there is also a responsibility with the party which cites the deposited resource. When citing, always cite the persistent identifier (DOI, ePIC) of the resource and not the resource itself.
