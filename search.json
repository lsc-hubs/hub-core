An alternative approach to evaluate performance is to extract the access logs of the service into an aggregation tool like Kibana and evaluate the number of requests exceeding the limits.\n[!NOTE]\nA common challenge to service performance is the provision of a WMS service on a big dataset. When requesting that dataset on a continental or national level, the server runs into problems drawing all the data at once. In such case consider to set up some cache/aggregation mechanism for larger areas. Setting proper min/max scale denominators may be a solution also.\njmeter is a utility which can run a series of performance and capacity tests on a webservice. Jmeter is a java program, which can run on most platforms.\n\nDownload the latest version from the apache website.\nUnzip the archive and run jmeter.bat from bin directory.\nFollow the build web test plan tutorial.\nCustomise the web test plan for your mapserver service\n\n[!NOTE]\nDo not perform a load test against a production url, it wil severely impact the performance of that service."

The popular search engines offer tooling to report on how the crawlers navigate through your data and how users find your services.

Because with every move, users need to be notified of the new location and documentation needs to be updated. When moving is relevant, consider to set up a forward-rule on the server which redirects users to the new location.\nAn interesting aspect of persistent identification is the choice of a domain and path name. A domain should represent enough credibility/authority (is this a trusted resource), and should be persistent for a longer period. A project name, for example, is not a good choice for a domain to publish a resource.\nA mechanism exists which facilitates file moves, without breaking their identification. Identifier providers such as DOI and W3ID enable to create a identifier for any resource. In documentation use the provided identifier, in case the location of the resource changes, you can update the link behind the identifier. Some organisations install a identification service themselves, so they have full ownership on the domain and the contents of the service. An example of such a service is the identification service of the German Federal Government."

    "text": "Bulk import from spreadsheet\nMany metadata initiatives tend to start from a spreadsheet. Each of the columns representa a metadata property and the rows are the individual records describing a resource. Spreadsheets have proven to be an effective medium to populate a catalogue with records. To facilitate this use case the GeoDataCrawler software provides an import spreadsheet method. The spreadsheet is parsed and a MCF document is generated for every row.\nSince every metadata initiative tends to have dedicated columns. A templating approach is used to convert from row to MCF. A default template is available, matching a default spreadsheet layout. If your spreadsheet layout is different, you need to adjust the template accordingly.\n\nFor this exercise we’ll use the LSC-hubs spreadsheet in combination with the LSC-hubs template. Notice that the template share the filename, but with extension .j2. Download both files to a new folder, called csv, in your working directory.\nFrom your shell environment run this command:\n\ncrawl-metadata --mode=import-csv --dir=\"./csv\"\n\nIf there are errors, check the paths and consider to open the CSV in Google Sheets and export it again or open it in a text editor to look for special cases. A known issue with this approach is that the crawler tool can not manage newline characters in text fields.\nOpen one of the generated MCF files to evaluate its content.\nA common spreadsheet tool is Microsoft Excel. If you open and export a spreadsheet from Excel, the CSV will use the ‘;’ character as column separator. Use the –sep=‘;’ parameter to indicate GeoDataCrawler to use this separator.\n\ncrawl-metadata --mode=import-csv --dir=\"./csv\" --sep=';'"

For this use case some options exist to import remote metadata. In many cases you want to import a selected subset of a remote catalogue. In this scenario we prepare a csv with the identifiers of the records to be imported. These identifiers are used to create a very minimal MCF file. GeoDataCrawler subsequently extends the local record with remote content. Currently supported are metadata from CSW, WMS and DOI.\n\nFor this exercise download a spreadsheet with a subset of the isric.org data repository and the relevant template to a folder isric.\nImport the CSV\n\ncrawl-metadata --mode=import-csv --dir=\"./isric\" --sep=';'\n\nThe synchronisation with remote content is implemented in GeoDataCrawler as part of the update metadata method. The update process will evaluate the dataseturi-property. If the uri refers to remote content in a supported format, the MCF will be updated against that content (remote takes preference).\n\ncrawl-metadata --mode=update --dir=\"./isric\"\n\nNotice the changes before and after running the script. If needed, you can remove all the MCF files and run import-csv again to restore the originals."

    "text": "Organisations organise their documents and datasets on various central network storages or databases. These resources are usually clustered in organisational units, projects and/or periods. Many files and database tables contain inherent metadata, such as the name, size, date, author, location etc. For example Excel, ESRI FileGeoDatabase, Geopackage and tiff files. It is important this information is included when exporting the data to an alternative context, such as a remote data repository.\nFor those formats which do not have embedded metadata, or in order to capture additional metadata aspects. We endorse the creation of a sidecar metadata file for every resource, a dedicated metadata file sharing the name of the datafile. This approach is for example common in the ESRI community, where a .shp.xml is created alongside any .shp or .tiff file, which captures metadata elements.\nThe inherent metadata can be used to generate an initial sidecar file. Data scientists can complement the metadata file to their needs. In this workshop, we are going to use this convention, to build up a discovery service for datasets within an organisation, at minimal effort for data scientists."

Aim of the format is ease of use, while providing export options to various metadata formats. Many (older) metadate formats are based on XML, which makes them quite hard to read by humans. MCF is based on YAML, a textbased format using indents to cluster elements. In this workshop we endorse the use of the MCF format due to its simplicity and natural fit with the use cases. A minimal sample of MCF is:\nmcf:\n    version: 1.0\n\nmetadata:\n    identifier: 9c36a048-4d28-453f-9373-94c90e101ebe\n    hierarchylevel: dataset\n    date: 2023-05-10\n\nidentification:\n    title: My favourite dataset\n    abstract: A sample dataset record to highlight the options of MCF\n    ...\nIn the next exercises, we are going to use a combination of MCF and iso19139:2007 to describe datasets (and alternate resources). iso19139:2007 is a standardised metadata format, commonly used in the spatial data community. Notice that MCF can also be combined with alternate metadata models, such as DCAT and STAC."

    "text": "Discovering an existing data repository\nFor this exersice we’ve prepared a minimal data repository containing a number of Excel-, Shape- and Tiff-files. Unzip the repository to a location on disk. Notice a index.yml in the root folder. The tool we use is able to inherit metadata properties from index.yml files through the file hierarchy. Open index.yml and customise the contact details. Later you will notice that these details will be applied to all datasets which themselves do not provide contact details. Consider to add additional index.yml files in other folders to override the values of index.yml at top level.\nThe tool we will use is based on python. It has some specific dependencies which are best installed via Conda. Conda creates a virtual python environment, so any activity will not interfere with the base python environment of your machine.\nIf you don’t have Conda, you can install Anaconda or Miniconda and consider to read the getting started.\nNow start a commandline or powershell with conda enabled (or add conda to your PATH). First we will navigate to the folder in which we unzipped the sample data repository. Make sure you are not in the data directory but one above.\ncd {path-where-you-unzipped-zipfile}\nWe will create a virtual environment (using Python 3.9) for our project and activate it.\nconda create --name pgdc python=3.9 \nconda activate pgdc\nNotice that you can deactivate this environment with: conda deactivate and you will return to the main Python environment. The tools we will install below, will not be available in the main environment.\nInstall the dependencies for the tool:\nconda install -c conda-forge gdal==3.3.2\nconda install -c conda-forge pysqlite3==0.4.6\nNow install the crawler tool, GeoDataCrawler. The tool is under active development at ISRIC and facilitates many of our data workflows. It is powered by some popular metadata and transformation libraries; OWSLib, pygeometa and GDAL.\npip install geodatacrawler\nVerify the different crawling options by typing:\ncrawl-metadata --help\nThe initial task for the tool is to create for every data file in our repository a sidecar file based on embedded metadata from the resource.\ncrawl-metadata --mode=init --dir=data\nNotice that for each resource a {dataset}.yml file has been created. Open a .yml file in a text editor and review its content.\nThe update mode is meant to be run at intervals, it will update the mcf files if changes have been made on a resource.\ncrawl-metadata --mode=update --dir=data\nIn certain cases the update mode will also import metadata from remote url’s. This happens for example if the dataset-uri is a DOI. The update mode will ten fetch metadata of the DOI and push it into the MCF.\nFinally we want to export the MCF’s to actual iso19139 metadata to be loaded into a catalogue like pycsw, GeoNetwork, CKAN etc.\ncrawl-metadata --mode=export --dir=data --dir-out=export --dir-out-mode=flat\nOpen one of the xml files and evaluate if the contact information from step 1 is available."

To see which instances are running (in the background) use docker ps. docker logs pycsw shows the logs of a container and docker stop pycsw stops the container. The -rm option removes the container at stop, so we can easily recreate it with additional options at next runs.\n\nFor administering the instance we use a utility called pycsw-admin.py.

Those services include authentication, issue management, release management, forks, pull requests and CI/CD. The types of digital assets maintained via GIT vary from software, deployment scripts, configuration files, documents, website content, metadata records up to actual datasets. Git is most effective with text based formats, which explains the popularity of formats like CSV, YAML, Markdown."

Tick the ’’\nBefore we add any content create a branch ‘gh-pages’ on the repository, this branch will later contain the generated html sources of the website.\nCreate a file _quarto.yml into the new git repository, with this content:\n\nproject:\n  type: website\nwebsite:\n  title: \"hello world\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.md\n        text: Home\n      - about.md\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n\nCreate file docs/index.md and docs/about.md. Start each file with a header:\n\n---\ntitle: Hello World\nauthor: Peter pan\ndate: 2023-11-11\n---\nAdd some markdown content to each page (under the header), for example:\n# Welcome\n\nWelcome to *my website*.\n\n- I hope you enjoy it.\n- Visit also my [about](./about.md) page.\n\nNow click on Actions in the github menu. Notice that Github has already set up a workflow to publish our content using jekyll, it should already be available at https://user.github.io/repo. We will not use this approach for now.\nRemove the existing workflow, generated by Github in Actions, Workflows, Remove\nFirst you need to allow the workflow-runner to make changes on the repository. For this, open Settings, Actions, General. Scroll down to Workflow permissions. Tick the Read and write permissions and click Save. If the option is grayed out, you first need to allow this feature in your organization.\nThen, from Actions, select New workflow, then set up a workflow yourself.\nOn the next page we will create a new workflow script, which is stored in the repository at /.github/workflows/main.yml.\n\nname: Docs Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: \n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with: \n          tinytex: true \n          path: docs\n      - name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n          path: docs\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      \n\nSave the file, via actions you can follow the progress of the workflow at every push to the repository.\nOn the logs notice how a container is initialised, the source code is checked out, the mkdocs dependency is installed, the build is made and pushed to the gh-pages branch.\n\nNotice that the syntax to define workflows is different for every CI-CD platform, however they generally follow a similar pattern. For Github identify in the file above:\n\nIt defines at what events the workflow should trigger (in this case at push events).\na build job is triggered, which indicates a container image (runs-on) to run the job in, then triggers some steps.\nThe final step triggers a facility of quarto to publish its output to a github repository\n\nThe above setup is optimal for co-creating a documentation repository for your community. Users can visit the source code via the edit on github link and suggest improvements via issues of pull requests. Notice that this tutorial is also maintained as markdown in Git."

OGC then initiated a new generation of standards based on these best practices.\nAn overview of both generations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nOWS\nOGC-API\n\n\n\n\nMap visualisation\nWeb Map service (WMS), Web Maps Tile Service (WMTS)\nOGCAPI:Maps, OGCAPI:Tiles\n\n\nVector access\nWeb Feature Service (WFS)\nOGCAPI:Features\n\n\nGrid access\nWeb Coverage Service (WCS)\nOGCAPI:Coverages\n\n\nSensor Observations\nSensor Observation Service (SOS)\nSensortthings\n\n\nProcesses\nWeb Processing Service (WPS)\nOGCAPI:Processes\n\n\nCatalogues\nCatalogue Service for the web (CSW)\nOGCAPI:Records\n\n\n\nNotice that most of the mapping software supports the standards of both generations. However, due to the recent introduction, expect incidental glitches in the implementations of recent OGC API’s."

    "text": "Setting up an API\nMapserver is server software which is able to expose datasets through various API’s. Examples of similar software are QGIS server, ArcGIS Server, Geoserver and pygeoapi.\nWe’ve selected mapserver for this training, because of its robustness and low resource consumption. Mapserver is configured using a configuration file, a mapfile. The mapfile defines metadata for the dataset and how users interact with the dataset, mainly the color scheme (legend) to draw a map of the dataset.\nVarious tools exist to write these configuration files, such as Mapserver studio, GeoStyler, QGIS Bridge, up to a visual studio plugin to edit mapfiles.\nThe GeoDataCrawler, introduced in a previous paragraph, also has an option to generate mapfiles. A big advantage of this approach is the integration with existing metadata. Many publication workflows require to add similar metadata at various locations, a risk for disambiguity. GeoDataCrawler will, during mapfile generation, use the existing metaddata, but also update the metadata so it includes a link to the mapserver service endpoint. This step enables a typical workflow of:\n\nUser finds a dataset in a catalogue\nThen opens the dataset via the linked service\n\nAs well as vice versa; from a mapping application, access the metadata describing a dataset."

The contents of the hub is maintained via a co-creation platform called github.com. You can either directly contribute via the github platform, but a feed back mechanism is also provided on each of the hub resources.\nProviding your feedback is crucial for several reasons:\n\nFirstly, incorporating diverse perspectives from stakeholders involved in working with and benefiting from land, soil, and crop information ensures that the LSC hub caters to the actual needs and demands of its users (Data providers/Users). This feedback allows for the fine-tuning of the hub’s functionalities, making it more user-friendly and effective in serving the specific requirements of different user groups.\nSecondly, gathering feedback facilitates continuous improvement. It provides an opportunity to identify potential shortcomings or areas needing enhancement within the LSC hubs. Insights from stakeholders enable the developers and administrators of the hub to address any challenges faced by users, thereby refining the system to better align with the expectations and requirements of its intended beneficiaries.\nMoreover, involving stakeholders in providing feedback fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration. When users feel heard and their inputs valued, it encourages their active participation and engagement with the LSC hub. This collaborative approach promotes a sense of ownership among stakeholders, leading to increased utilization and sustained support for the system in the long term.\nUltimately, the feedback obtained from diverse stakeholders during the Rwanda WP4 workshop plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the LSC hub evolves as a valuable, user-centric platform, effectively supporting decision-making processes related to land, soil, and crop information in Rwanda’s agricultural landscape.\n\nEvery page or resource on the hub provides an option to provide feedback and/or ask a question related to the content. In these sections, you can provide feedback about the page and what you would like to be adjusted.\n\n\n\nfeedback page\n\n\nContributions to the hub require a Github login. A GIThub account is easily made by pressing on sign in with GIThub, then click on New to GIThub? Create an account.\nYou only need to decide on a username, and password and enter your email address.\n\n\n\nfeedback github\n\n\nOnce logged in, you can now comment below the pages. If you have an account, You can provide feedback by contributing to hub discussions at the github repository. To get started, you can create a new discussion.\n\n\n\nfeedback discussion\n\n\nExercise 5: Create a GIThub account and start a discussion at the GIThub repository."

    "text": "You are very much invited to contribute to the development of the hub. The contents of the hub is maintained via a co-creation platform called github.com. You can either directly contribute via the github platform, but a feed back mechanism is also provided on each of the hub resources.\nProviding your feedback is crucial for several reasons:\n\nFirstly, incorporating diverse perspectives from stakeholders involved in working with and benefiting from land, soil, and crop information ensures that the LSC hub caters to the actual needs and demands of its users (Data providers/Users). This feedback allows for the fine-tuning of the hub’s functionalities, making it more user-friendly and effective in serving the specific requirements of different user groups.\nSecondly, gathering feedback facilitates continuous improvement. It provides an opportunity to identify potential shortcomings or areas needing enhancement within the LSC hubs. Insights from stakeholders enable the developers and administrators of the hub to address any challenges faced by users, thereby refining the system to better align with the expectations and requirements of its intended beneficiaries.\nMoreover, involving stakeholders in providing feedback fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration. When users feel heard and their inputs valued, it encourages their active participation and engagement with the LSC hub. This collaborative approach promotes a sense of ownership among stakeholders, leading to increased utilization and sustained support for the system in the long term.\nUltimately, the feedback obtained from diverse stakeholders during the Rwanda WP4 workshop plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the LSC hub evolves as a valuable, user-centric platform, effectively supporting decision-making processes related to land, soil, and crop information in Rwanda’s agricultural landscape.\n\nEvery page or resource on the hub provides an option to provide feedback and/or ask a question related to the content. In these sections, you can provide feedback about the page and what you would like to be adjusted.\n\n\n\nfeedback page\n\n\nContributions to the hub require a Github login. A GIThub account is easily made by pressing on sign in with GIThub, then click on New to GIThub? Create an account.\nYou only need to decide on a username, and password and enter your email address.\n\n\n\nfeedback github\n\n\nOnce logged in, you can now comment below the pages. If you have an account, You can provide feedback by contributing to hub discussions at the github repository. To get started, you can create a new discussion.\n\n\n\nfeedback discussion\n\n\nExercise 5: Create a GIThub account and start a discussion at the GIThub repository."
