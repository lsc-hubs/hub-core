This strategy outlines how to integrate these principles into the development, maintenance, and archiving of project websites and data and/or knowledge hubs, which are developed as part of a research project. Central in this strategy is to establish robust archiving practices for long-term content preservation, because due to their nature, project websites and knowledge hubs have a high likelihood of content alteration and discontinuation.\nProject websites and especially knowledge hubs developed in large Horizon Europe projects have a tendency to contain unique information which is not available elsewhere on the web. Due to the project timeline, the websites and hubs tend to be unmaintained after the project, handed over to a second party, abandoned or discontinued. If not carefully archived this unique information has a high risk of being lost. The project websites are ofter referenced from journal articles and (progress) reports. A progress report typically aims to reference a specific state of the deliverable, which is difficult if the content of the system is dynamic. For both scenario’s, it is of interest to persist the state of the system at intervals, but at least at project finalisation, to facilitate consistent access to the content and accurate citation.\nThis document provides a strategy on how to facilitate a process in which the content of an online system is operated and archived following the FAIR principles."

Funding agencies, institutions, and researchers themselves should therefore treat the deposition of all significant research outputs into certified repositories as a non-negotiable final step in the research lifecycle.\nThere are various reasons why relevant reports are incidentally not deposited in a library. It is relevant to identify and prevent these reasons, so all relevant information is carefully archived.\n\nThe researcher or funder may require non-disclosure or an embargo period. Consider that most repositories offer functionality for selective disclosure or embargoed access.\nIn some cases researchers accidently select non persistent media to disclose an asset. Capacity building or proper guidance may prevent the situation.\n\nAn aspect incidentally overlooked is that besides publishing in a persistent repository, there is also a responsibility with the party which cites the deposited resource. When citing, always cite the persistent identifier (DOI, ePIC) of the resource and not the resource itself.\n\nReferences\nWilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, … & Mons, B. (2016).

    "text": "Introduction\nThe effective use of vocabularies and glossaries is critical in Horizon Europe research projects to ensure interoperability, clarity, and reuse of knowledge. This strategy outlines best practices for the creation, adoption, and maintenance of vocabularies throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n\nWhy Agree on a Vocabulary at the Start of the Project\n\nCommon Understanding: Establishing a shared vocabulary at the project outset fosters a mutual understanding among diverse stakeholders.\n\nImproved Collaboration: A clear glossary reduces ambiguity and enhances communication across disciplines, countries, and institutions.\n\nData Interoperability: Agreeing on standard terms supports seamless data integration, especially in multi-source datasets.\n\nKnowledge Retention: It aids in documentation, ensuring that terms and their meanings are preserved for future reference and impact assessment.\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Effective Vocabularies\n\nUniquely Identifiable Terms: Each concept or term should be assigned a persistent, globally unique identifier (e.g., URI) to avoid confusion and enable precise referencing.\n\nRich Semantic Relationships: Terms should be connected through relations with eligible vocabularies, such as AgroVoc, Gemet, EuroVoc, ISO11074 via relations such as:\n\nskos:exactMatch: Indicates that two terms can be used interchangeably.\n\nskos:closeMatch: Suggests the terms are similar but not interchangeable in all contexts.\n\nskos:broader: Shows a hierarchical relationship where one term is more general.\n\nskos:narrower: Shows a more specific concept within a broader term.\n\nAlignment with Existing Standards: Reuse and align with established vocabularies (e.g., SKOS, Dublin Core, schema.org) whenever possible.\n\n\n\nSteps for Vocabulary Management\n\nInitial Scoping: Identify key domains and stakeholders.\n\nTerm Collection: Gather terms from partners, existing ontologies, and relevant documentation.\n\nConsensus Building: Facilitate workshops to agree on preferred terms and definitions.\n\nModeling and Encoding: Represent the vocabulary using semantic web standards (e.g., RDF, SKOS).\n\nPublishing: Publish the vocabulary on a persistent, accessible platform with both human-readable and machine-readable views. Register the published vocabulary in vocabulary catalogues, such as\n\nMaintenance: Regularly review and update the vocabulary to reflect project developments.\n\n\n\nTerms collection in a spreadsheet\nSpreadsheets are an effective tool to collect and discuss terms with contributors. The spreadsheet is either hosted on a shared environment (sharepoint, google docs) with multiple editors, or hosted as a CSV in Github (contributions added via pull requests).\nA typical structure for the spreadsheet is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\npreflabel\naltlabel\ndefinition\nExact- match\nClose-match\nbroader\nnarrower\n\n\n\n\ntree\ntree\ntree crop\nwoody perennials\nhttp://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_34134\n#wood, #timber\n#forest\n#oak, #spruce, #pine\n\n\n\nLabels are classified as the preferred label and alternative labels (synonyms). The 4 last columns indicate relationships between concepts, either relations within the document (indicated with #), but it can also have links to remote vocabularies.\nLabels and Definition can be captured in various languages, either as extra columns or in a separate spreadsheet\n\n\n\nID\npreflabel\naltlabel\ndefinition\nlanguage\n\n\n\n\ntree\ntree\n\n\nen\n\n\ntree\narbre\n\n\nfr\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a machine readable interface\nSimple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a commonly used ontology to organise concepts their definitions and relations. Various guidances and tools exist which are able to produce a SKOS concept scheme from a spreadsheet. The result is a json-ld, xml/rdf or turtle file, which can be deposited at a vocabulary repository, such as\nConcepts are identified by an identifier which preferably resolve to the definition of the concept, when used as web address in a browser or data tool. The prefix of the identifier (https://example.com/vocab#) references the actual document or a proxy is placed in between, which forwards users to where the document is hosted.\nCommonly available proxy solutions are w3id.org and doi.org.\nVocabulary repositories such as AgroPortal typically facilitate the full process of deposit and handling of concept identifiers.\n\n\nProviding an HTML Interface for Human Browsing\nTo ensure accessibility and usability of the vocabulary by non-technical users, an HTML interface should be developed. This interface should:\n\nPresent vocabulary entries in an intuitive, searchable, and hierarchical format.\n\nAllow users to browse terms, view definitions, and explore semantic relationships (broader, narrower, exact match, etc.).\n\nInclude filtering, keyword search, and alphabetic navigation.\n\nSupport multilingual labels and definitions if applicable.\n\nBe responsive and accessible across devices.\n\nRecommended approaches include:\n\nUsing tools such as Skosmos, Widoco or VocView to render SKOS vocabularies as user-friendly HTML pages.\n\nEmbedding RDFa or JSON-LD in the HTML to maintain machine-readability alongside human-readability.\n\nIf proxy software is used, the proxy can be configured to identify if the visiting client is a web browser or a machine, and forward the client to the relevant representation of the concept.\nThis mechanism is used by Glosis Web Ontology. Depending on the type of client a request to http://w3id.org/glosis/model/layerhorizon/ManganeseExtractableElements is forwarded to the relevant location.\n\n\nConclusion\nAgreeing on and managing vocabularies is foundational to the success of Horizon Europe research projects. By ensuring consistency, discoverability, and interoperability of terms, research outputs become more usable and impactful within and beyond the project consortium."

Services can vary from web services (APIs), SMS services, brochures, up to on site visits.\nPredictions on distribution of environmental parameters in time and space, as well as yield predictions, are calculated using statistical, rule based, and/or machine learning models. Commonly available models are described as resources in the hub.\nIn the hub various software components are described which enable visualisation and/or analysis of relevant data and knowledge sources\nApproaches describe commonly known mechanisms to improve land management to overcome challenges such as erosion, limited fertility, salinisation, and climate change.\nThe hub describes relevant policies to the Land Soil Crop community. Policy drives the collection of data, but data can also support policy development.\n\nThe hub does not store data or documents directly, but acts as a facility to easily discover and access information. Following the FAIR principles, the hub encourages information providers to store their works in presistent repositories, such as the Open Science Foundation, Datadryad or Zenodo and reference the publication from the hub. With every publication to a repository, the work can be identified using a persistent identifier (typically doi, handle.net or ePic).

It shows, for example, for the property pH, 4 maps: the 5% prediction value, the 95% prediction value, the median of predictions and the pH map.\nThe values are given for pH*10 for better visualisation. Under the data preview, the metadata of the map is given. You can add the map to the map viewer by clicking on Add to the map.\n\n\n\nmapviewer add\n\n\nYou can add as many maps to the Mapviewer as you want. For example, you add another map of Organic Carbon.\n\n\n\nmapviewer add2\n\n\nIf you now click on the compare button as described in the previous section, and put one layer to the left and the other to the right, you can compare the layers side-by-side.\n\n\n\nmapviewer compare2\n\n\nAbout data brings you back to the Explore map Data, and shows you the metadata describing the map. The description gives in addition which datasets are used to generate the maps.\n\nUpload provides the option to open a dataset from the local computer. Note that this data is not uploaded to a server, so this data is not shared with anyone else. You can also add web data from this panel to the map viewer.\n\n\n\n\nmapviewer localweb\n\n\nFor local files, you first need to select a file type. The file should have a spatial component and/or coordinates to add it to the map viewer. In step 2, you browse your file on your local computer.\n\n\n\nmapviewer local\n\n\nFor web data, you first need to select the file or web service type. In step 2, you will add the URL to add the web data. For example, you can add the ESA land cover map as a WMS layer. The URL is: https://worldcover2020.esa.int/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1\n\n\n\nmapviewer web\n\n\nYou can compare these maps with other added maps, through the compare button.\n\n\n\nmapviewer compare2\n\n\n\nAs soon as layers are loaded on the map, you can set the order of the layers, view a legend of the layer, zoom to its extent, set its opacity and view the metadata of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe steps of this exercise are written down under the help button. By clicking on Take the tour, it will guide you through the steps.\n\n\n\nSearch for a location to quickly find an area of interest\nUse ‘Explore map data’ to view the catalogue of available data sets and add at least two to the map\nInteract with the data layer, including opacity and toggling on and off on the left in your workbench, compare the maps by using the compare button\nClick on the data on the map to view more detailed data, including the raw data\nChange your base map using options in ‘Map Settings’ to help make some data sets more visible\nZoom and change your view, including tilting the view angle using the controls on the right-hand side of the screen\n\n\n\nDownload data as files or from web services\nData is made available in various formats by the providers of the data. Common are file downloads in Excel, Esri Shape or GeoTiff format. Some organisations provide data access via web services. Web services enable partial downloads of a dataset, filtered by attribute, temporal or spatial extent. Common web service types are:\n\nOGC:WMS visualizes spatial data in map viewers\nOGC:WFS downloads a part of a vector dataset\nOGC:WCS downloads a part of a grid dataset\n\nVarious software is available to interect with these data formats and data services. In this article we explain how you can use QGIS Desktop to interact with web services for spatial data."

You can either directly contribute via the github platform, but a feed back mechanism is also provided on each of the hub resources.\nProviding your feedback is crucial for several reasons:\n\nFirstly, incorporating diverse perspectives from stakeholders involved in working with and benefiting from land, soil, and crop information ensures that the LSC hub caters to the actual needs and demands of its users (Data providers/Users). This feedback allows for the fine-tuning of the hub’s functionalities, making it more user-friendly and effective in serving the specific requirements of different user groups.\nSecondly, gathering feedback facilitates continuous improvement. It provides an opportunity to identify potential shortcomings or areas needing enhancement within the LSC hubs. Insights from stakeholders enable the developers and administrators of the hub to address any challenges faced by users, thereby refining the system to better align with the expectations and requirements of its intended beneficiaries.\nMoreover, involving stakeholders in providing feedback fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration. When users feel heard and their inputs valued, it encourages their active participation and engagement with the LSC hub. This collaborative approach promotes a sense of ownership among stakeholders, leading to increased utilization and sustained support for the system in the long term.\nUltimately, the feedback obtained from diverse stakeholders during the workshop plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the LSC hub evolves as a valuable, user-centric platform, effectively supporting decision-making processes related to land, soil, and crop information in the agricultural landscape.\n\nEvery page or resource on the hub provides an option to provide feedback and/or ask a question related to the content. In these sections, you can provide feedback about the page and what you would like to be adjusted."
