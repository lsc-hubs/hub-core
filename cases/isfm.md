# {{< var country >}} Integrated Soil Fertility Management

Current fertilizer and soil fertility recommendations are not linked to local context, conditions and climate risks. 
Too general information may lead to declining soil fertility and soil health, low and uncertain productivity, fertilizer wastage, loss of organic matter, and environmental risks.
The LSC-hub aims to incease availability of up-to-date and localised information related to Soil Fertility. 

This page presents a number of scenario's in which accurate data plays a role.

## Maize

Maize is the most important cereal crop in Kenya. It is the staple food for most rural population. It is used as a human food, animal feed, production of beverages and also making of bio-fuel. Maize is a versatile crop with a wide genetic base and a large number of varieties growing across a range of agro-ecological zones (AEZ) and soil types and having differing maturity periods. However, maize grows best on well-drained, well-aerated, deep soils containing adequate organic matter and well supplied with requisite nutrients. Maize will produce 2 metric tons per hectare under good management

## Sorghum

Sorghum is the firth most important cereal grown in the world. It is an indigenous crop to Kenya and is a basic staple food crop for many rural communities in the country, especially in more drought-prone areas. It is important for food, animal fodder, bio-fuel and production of alcohol and beverages. The crop is adapted to a wide range of environments, able to perform better than most crops under extreme climatic conditions, from excessive dry spells to excessively moist conditions, and under varied temperatures and soil types
