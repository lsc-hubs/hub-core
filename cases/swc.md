# {{< var country >}} Soil Water Conservation

Soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts should be geared towards equal distribution of water during wet and dry seasons and soil erosion control for enhanced maintenance of soil organic matter and soil physical properties.

## Soil threats

source: [FAO](http://www.fao.org/3/i5126e/i5126e.pdf)

### [Soil erosion](./threats/erosion.md)
Serious water erosion occurs in regions with dry and wet seasons covering
South Asia to East Asia, particularly in the hilly and mountainous landscapes.
However, it is of little concern for well-established forests and paddy fields.
Wind erosion is concentrated mainly in the most western and northern arid
and semi-arid regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and China. [Read more](./threats/erosion.md)

## Organic carbon change
Increase in crop yield retains soil organic carbon (SOC) in croplands of East
and Southeast Asia. Whereas, SOC is decreasing in South Asia, because crop
residues are widely used as fuel and fodder, and not returned to the soil.
The degradation of grassland has caused great losses of SOC stock.

## Salinisation and sodification
The threat of salinisation/sodification in the Asia region is widespread but
variable. In semiarid and arid zones of central Asia, salt-affected soils are widely
distributed. On the other hand, salt- affected soils are developed in certain
coastal areas in monsoon zones, mainly by salt water intrusion in South and
Southeast Asia.

## Nutrient imbalance
Negative soil nutrients balances have been reported for N, P, K and
micronutrients in many…” South Asian countries. Whereas, large excess of
nutrients, in particular N, causes serious environmental problems in other
countries.

## Contamination
Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and intensive farming causes
contamination of heavy metals (Cd, Ni, As, Pb, Zn, etc.) and pesticides in
various parts of Asia, which, in turn, poses a serious risk to human health.

## Soil sealing and land take
Rapid urbanization and development of mega-cites significantly increased the
rate of impervious surface area (ISA). Asia region has the largest ISA within the
global regions.

## Soil acidification
There is substantial area of acid soils distributed in tropical and subtropical
regions of Asia, mainly in Southeast Asia, parts of East and South Asia.
This is mainly caused by unbalanced and unsuitable application of chemical
fertilizers. Distribution of acid sulphate soils in tropical Asia also limits crop
production.

## Compaction
Mechanization of land management has increased compaction of surface soil
and/or subsoil in cropland, grassland and timber forests. Increase in livestock
trampling is also a major cause of surface soil compaction in grassland and hilly
region.

## Waterlogging 
Anthropogenic activates such as poor drainage system and deforestation in the
upstream areas increase the threat to waterlogging in the flood prone areas.

## Loss of soil biodiversity
Limited information is available for soil biodiversity in Asia. Some reports show
high microbial biodiversity in the soils of organic farming lands.
